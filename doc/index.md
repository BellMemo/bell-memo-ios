### documentation about swift or useful message

```text

Swift is a programming language used to develop applications for Apple devices like the iPhone and Apple Watch. 
It is a modern replacement for C-based languages which were previously used for Apple development.

Many of the applications you see on the Apple App Store today were written in Swift. 
In fact, most applications for Apple devices are written in Swift today, other than legacy ones. 
This is because Swift is the recommended language to use for Apple development.

**1: Set Up the Environment**

```text

Every programming language demands a particular environment where developers can easily code with their full potential. 
Xcode offers you just such an environment that is used for Swift to code applications.

The Xcode consists of a code editor compiler, debugger, 
and a project organizer along with additional tools to help you during the development process.

The majority of Swift developers use Xcode to develop iOS applications. 
However, you also need a Mac computer to use this IDE. If you do not have a Mac device, 
then you won’t be able to run Xcode, which is a huge downside for such an environment.

**2: Learn the Basic**

```text

Every beginner starts with basic concepts that make it easier to understand advanced ones later. 
Swift is a modern language that Apple developed by keeping beginners in focus, 
and the syntax is kept simple so that everyone can learn its basics.

There are numerous impressive Swift courses available if you want to learn it the easy way. 
These courses take you from a basic to an advanced level where you learn about new frameworks. 
Moreover, here are some free sources where you can clear up your basic awareness:

**3: Understand Coding Logic**

```text

Swift code is the root of application functioning. 
There is a logic behind every functionality you tend to insert in your app. 
When starting from scratch, you need to understand both the code and the logic behind this code to efficiently develop a program.

```

**4: Keep Practicing**

```text

Once you have basic concepts in your mind, then it’s time to explore more about the language. 
Try writing code for different applications that are backed by logic. Explore Swift Forums and interact with other Swift developers.

The community can really help you grow fast, and you can ask questions of Swift experts to gain valuable experience. 
Check how other people are writing their codes and how they are utilizing logic.

```

**5: Develop Applications**

```text

Once you are done with the fundamentals and have been practicing the concepts for a few months, 
then it’s time to gain experience. Stop watching tutorials and start your own project with a simple idea. 
Start by designing your app features, then move to its data structure.
